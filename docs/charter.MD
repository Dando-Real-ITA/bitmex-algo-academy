## Article I: Guild Values

### Section 1: Contribution to the Guild's Algorithms

We value the continuous improvement and innovation of our trading algorithms. Each member of Algo Academy is encouraged to actively contribute their expertise, ideas, and resources to enhance our collective algorithms. We recognize that our strength lies in the synergy of our members' contributions.

### Section 3: Interaction with the Community

At Algo Academy, we place a strong emphasis on education and collaboration. We are dedicated to helping new and potential members explore the world of algorithmic trading. Our commitment extends to assisting them in setting up, learning about, and successfully running algorithmic trading strategies.

**Key Activities Include:**

1. **Educational Initiatives**: We organize workshops, webinars, and training sessions to impart knowledge about algorithmic trading. Our aim is to ensure that every member has access to the resources and guidance needed to thrive in this field.

2. **Hands-On Learning**: We encourage hands-on learning by facilitating access to trading platforms, tools, and resources. This enables members to apply what they've learned in a real-world trading environment.

3. **Community Support**: Algo Academy fosters a supportive community where members can ask questions, seek help, and engage in constructive discussions related to algorithmic trading.

4. **Knowledge Sharing**: We promote the sharing of research, trading ideas, and successful strategies within our community. This collaborative environment ensures that members can learn from each other's experiences.

By actively engaging with the community and focusing on education, Algo Academy aims to empower all members, regardless of their level of experience, to excel in algorithmic trading. We believe that an informed and educated community is the foundation of our success.

## Article II: Use of Guild Funds

Guild funds may be allocated for trading with the best-performing guild algorithm. This allocation will be determined by the guild leadership and guided by the principle of optimizing returns on investment.

### Section 2: Distribution to Guild Members

- **Task-Based Rewards**: Members who actively contribute to the guild's success, including but not limited to algorithm development, may be eligible for rewards from the guild pot.

- **Contributions to Algorithms**: Members who make significant contributions to algorithm development may receive compensation from the guild funds as recognition of their valuable contributions.

### Section 3: Loans to Guild Members

To facilitate the growth and development of our members, loans may be granted from the guild funds to support algorithm trading activities. The terms and conditions of such loans will be determined by the guild leadership in accordance with the guild's financial policies.

### Section 4: Marketing to Grow the Guild

Funds may be allocated for marketing and promotional activities aimed at expanding Algo Academy's membership base and enhancing our visibility in the algorithmic trading community. Such initiatives shall be subject to approval by the guild leadership.

### Section 5: Advanced Notice of Distribution

- **Bespoke Distribution**: Due to the BitMEX guild functionality limitations, if there is a bespoke distribution for the week, all funds will be withdrawn by the guild master, and then the excess will be redeposited back into the guild. Bespoke distribution will be itemized in the #guild-pot-distribution channel at least 3 days before distribution.

The guild leadership, including but not limited to the Guild Master and admins, shall be responsible for overseeing the responsible use of guild funds, setting trading strategies, and ensuring the alignment of guild activities with the values outlined in this charter.

## Article IV: Guild Partners

Algo Academy is proud to collaborate with esteemed partners in the algorithmic trading industry. As of the establishment of this charter, our guild partners are BitMEX and ProfitView.

**Our Partners:**

1. **BitMEX**: BitMEX, the original Bitcoin derivatives exchange and still the best, provides the essential guild community functionality required for our existence. BitMEX's platform also offers the necessary systems that enable efficient algorithmic trading, ensuring that our members have the tools they need to thrive in the cryptocurrency market.

2. **ProfitView**: ProfitView, a founding member of our guild, is our preferred system for the deployment and operation of our algorithms. Their commitment to our guild's success has been invaluable, and their platform plays a crucial role in our trading strategies and operations.

*Note: This guild charter is a living document and may be revised or amended as needed to reflect the evolving needs and priorities of Algo Academy.*
